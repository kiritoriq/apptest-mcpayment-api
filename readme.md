# TASK
### 2. Budget Application
We need to have a web app that can help us track our income, expenses and the balance, and all the data is stored / fetched via REST API to backend server.
Point to review:
- 1. You have to create backend server for REST API endpoint
- 2. You have to make a responsive site for the frontend
- 3. Make a nice UI using CSS build by yourself (would be nice to have pre-processor SASS / LESS), without any framework like bootstrap etc
- 4. Javascript fundamental, Please show us what you got about javascript
- 5. No jquery
- 6. Write a clean and scalable code is nice to have
